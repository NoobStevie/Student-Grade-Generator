# Description
This repository solves the following code challenges:

* Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks
* Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
* Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
